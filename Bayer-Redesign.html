	<div class="ProjectDescription">Bayer was ready for a fresh look and feel to their site in 2024, so I was asked to come up with a completely new design. I had to learn their brand and what features are important to their shoppers. After learning that headwear is their biggest seller, I developed a new hero image feature all about headwear. I created a “shop by brand” section with easy-to-find logos to make navigating the site more user friendly for any Bayer shopper. I used some of the new creative photography that was done in the spring to enhance the look of the new site.
