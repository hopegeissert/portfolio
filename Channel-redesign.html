	<div class="ProjectDescription">Channel was ready for a fresh look and feel to their site in 2024, so I was asked to come up with a new design. I studied their brand to come up with ideas to refresh the site. Using their elements of arches and angled buttons, I applied these styles throughout the site and featured new photography that was done in the spring. Headwear is a top seller for them, so I created a site design that revolved around that.
